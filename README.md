# Mathlete

The name of the project is Mathlete. The name derives from the word "athlete". 
In this project I created a basic mathematics tool for students 9-12 years old. I have made 3 different module for the different age groups. First you need to answer some personal question such as name, gender, age etc to direct you to the right module. I used Python 3 to create this project.
